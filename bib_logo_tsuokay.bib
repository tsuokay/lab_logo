   abstract = {A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes a real-world object or environment to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance (i.e. color). The collected data can then be used to construct digital three-dimensional models. 3D laser scanning developed during the last half of the 20th century in an attempt to accurately recreate the surfaces of various objects and places. The technology is especially helpful in fields of research and design. The first 3D scanning technology was created in the 1960s. The early scanners used lights, cameras and projectors to perform this task. Due to limitations of the equipment it often took a lot of time and effort to scan objects accurately. Collected 3D data is useful for a wide variety of applications. These devices are used extensively by the entertainment industry in the production of movies or virtual reality. Other common applications of this technology include industrial design, orthotics and prosthetics, reverse engineering and prototyping, quality control/inspection and documentation of cultural artifacts.},

ABSTRACT = {The image-based modeling and simulation of plant growth have numerous and diverse applications. In this study, we used image-based and manual field measurements to develop and validate a methodology to simulate strawberry (Fragaria &times; ananassa Duch.) plant canopies throughout the Florida strawberry growing season. The simulated plants were used to create a synthetic image using radiative transfer modeling. Observed canopy properties were incorporated into an L-system simulator, and a series of strawberry canopies corresponding to specific weekly observation dates were created. The simulated canopies were compared visually with actual plant images and quantitatively with in-situ leaf area throughout the strawberry season. A simple regression model with L-system-derived and in-situ total leaf areas had an Adj&nbsp;R2 value of 0.78. The L-system simulated canopies were used to derive information needed for image simulation, such as leaf area and leaf angle distribution. Spectral and plant canopy information were used to create synthetic high spatial resolution multispectral images using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) software. Vegetation spectral indices were extracted from the simulated image and used to develop multiple regression models of in-situ biophysical parameters (leaf area and dry biomass), achieving Adj&nbsp;R2 values of 0.63 and 0.50, respectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Red Edge Simple Ratio (SRre) vegetation indices, which utilize the red, red edge, and near infrared bands of the spectrum, were identified as statistically significant variables (p &lt; 0.10). This study showed that both geometric (canopy seize metrics) and spectral variables were successful in modeling in-situ biomass and leaf area. Combining the geometric and spectral variables, however, only slightly improved the prediction model. These results show the feasibility of simulating strawberry canopies and images with inherent geometrical, topological, and spectral properties of real strawberry plants. The simulated canopies and images can be used in applications beyond creating realistic computer graphics for quantitative applications requiring the depiction of vegetation biological processes, such as stress modeling and remote sensing mission planning.},

abstract = {Studying growth and development of plants is of central importance in botany. Current quantitative are either limited to tedious and sparse manual measurements, or coarse image-based 2D measurements. Availability of cheap and portable 3D acquisition devices has the potential to automate this process and easily provide scientists with volumes of accurate data, at a scale much beyond the realms of existing methods. However, during their development, plants grow new parts (e.g., vegetative buds) and bifurcate to different components --- violating the central incompressibility assumption made by existing acquisition algorithms, which makes these algorithms unsuited for analyzing growth. We introduce a framework to study plant growth, particularly focusing on accurate localization and tracking topological events like budding and bifurcation. This is achieved by a novel forward-backward analysis, wherein we track robustly detected plant components back in time to ensure correct spatio-temporal event detection using a locally adapting threshold. We evaluate our approach on several groups of time lapse scans, often ranging from days to weeks, on a diverse set of plant species and use the results to animate static virtual plants or directly attach them to physical simulators.},

@article{Mildenhall2020,
   abstract = {We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location $(x,y,z)$ and viewing direction $(\theta, \phi)$) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons.},
